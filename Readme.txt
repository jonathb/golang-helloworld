3 years ago I wanted to learn golang thing. ?TODO a better idea would be to merge this into ztools and colect some "real" golang toos, now that HelloWorld-from-golang is no longer interesting.

Of particular interest are:

- simple starter things like command line args,

- classes and goroutines

- the builtin packages
 
- PS: test the new gpg key again 1519
